## **COVID Layoffs End-to-End Data Handling & Analysis: ##** MySQL Cleanup, Power BI Visualization, AWS-Snowflake Integration**##

In the wake of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the global employment landscape experienced seismic shifts. For employees, 
these changes meant unfortunate workforce reductions.
This project, 

"COVID Layoffs End-to-End Data Handling & Analysis : MySQL Cleanup, AWS-Snowflake Integration, Power BI Visualization" focuses on the pivotal role of data engineering in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on employment.
As a data engineer, one of my primary task is to transform raw data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis. 
This involves meticulous data cleansing, aggregation, and enrichment which ensures that the data is reliable and ready for further exploration by data scientists and analysts.

OBJECTIVES:
1. Create and organize database
2. Duplicates removal
3. Data enrichment via standardizing data and null value handling
4. Perform EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) & Power BI visualization 
5. Automated data loading via Snowpipe (AWS S3 &  Snowflake integration)
By demonstrating these essential data engineering skills and tasks to transform raw data into a reliable and insightful dataset. We ensures the data is ready for analysis by data scientists and analysts. 
Lets get started !
