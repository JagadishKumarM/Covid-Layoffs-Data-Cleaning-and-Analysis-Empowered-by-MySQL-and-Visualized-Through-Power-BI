## **Covid-Layoffs:**
## **Data Cleaning and Analysis Empowered by MySQL and Visualized Through Power BI**

In the wake of the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, the global employment landscape experienced seismic shifts. For employees, 
these changes meant unfortunate workforce reductions.
This project, "Covid-Layoffs: Data Cleaning and Analysis with MySQL," focuses on the pivotal role of data engineering in understanding the impact of COVID-19 on employment. 
As a data engineer, one of my primary task is to transform raw data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis. This involves meticulous data cleansing, aggregation, and enrichment which ensures that the data is reliable and ready for further exploration by data scientists and analysts.

OBJECTIVES:

1. Create and organize database
2. Duplicates removal 
3. Data enrichment via standardizing data 
4. Null value handling and removal of unnecessary columns and rows
5. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
6. Data Visualization via Power BI

We will achieve these objectives using MySQL, demonstrating the essential data engineering skills and tasks needed to transform raw data into a reliable and insightful dataset. 
This process ensures the data is ready for analysis by data scientists and analysts!
